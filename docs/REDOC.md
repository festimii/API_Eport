# Editing the ReDoc page

The ReDoc UI is now served by a custom route so you can adjust its appearance without touching FastAPI internals.

## Where to change things
- **Route definition:** `main.py` in the `/redoc` endpoint uses `get_redoc_html`.
- **Script source:** The ReDoc bundle URL is configured in `redoc_html` via the `redoc_js_url` argument.
- **Page title:** Also set in `redoc_html` through the `title` argument.

## Common tweaks
1. **Swap the ReDoc version or host locally**
   - Edit `redoc_js_url` in `main.py` to point at another CDN version or a locally hosted bundle.
   - Restart the app to load the new bundle.

2. **Add custom fonts or styles**
   - Set `with_google_fonts=True` if you want the default ReDoc fonts.
   - Wrap the returned HTML in your own template if you need custom CSS/JS. You can copy the `get_redoc_html` output and extend it.

3. **Change the OpenAPI source**
   - Update the `openapi_url` passed to `get_redoc_html` if you expose the schema at a different path.

## Quick steps to edit
1. Open `main.py` and search for `redoc_html`.
2. Adjust the arguments passed to `get_redoc_html` (title, script URL, fonts, etc.).
3. Save the file and restart the FastAPI service.

With these hooks you can fully customize ReDoc while keeping the autogenerated documentation intact.
